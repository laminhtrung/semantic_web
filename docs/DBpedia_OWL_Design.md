# DBpedia-based Movie Ontology: Evidence-driven Design

This design is grounded in the existing crawled dataset. Domain facts are not invented. The native build, application and query modes share these version-three definitions and canonical exports.

## 1. Findings and semantic decisions

- Reuse dbo:Film, Person, Actor, Writer, MovieDirector, ScreenWriter, Producer, Company, Organisation, Award, MovieGenre, Genre, Country, Language, Work, Artist and Agent. Actor follows the original dbo:starring range; no equivalent-class override of dbo:Actor.
- Reuse dbo:director, starring, writer, producer, productionCompany, award, genre, country, language and runtime. Preserve reference domain/range: starring ranges over Actor, producer over Agent, productionCompany over Company.
- dbo:MovieDirector, ScreenWriter and Producer are reused for occupation-level inferences from the corresponding credits. One-way subclass axioms suffice; their global definitions are not overridden. - dbo:runtime is seconds (xsd:double); Inception has 8880 seconds, converted from the crawled 148 minutes. Titles reuse rdfs:label (annotation property, not a custom datatype property).
- P577 has varying precision. Keep a documented local releaseYear summary instead of inventing a full dbo:releaseDate. Budget, gross, IMDb, distributors and ratings are excluded because they are not in the collected field set.
- Remove unsupported Documentary/Fiction hierarchy and FeatureFilm assertions: Wikidata Q11424 means film and does not justify feature-film classification. Award labels alone do not justify treating every unrecognized award as a film award.
- ActionGenre and DramaGenre are transparent label-normalization buckets, not source-provided OWL classes. The author-specified classification rule is separate from the crawled facts; fiction/non-fiction is not guessed.
- Contribution and four role individuals represent P57/P161/P58/P162 credits. Each record has exactly one person, film and role. Missing values remain an open-world validation issue, not automatic inconsistency.
- MultiCreditContributor / ThreeCreditContributor mean at least two/three distinct credit records. Different roles provide witnesses; these class names do not prove exactly two/three unique roles across an entire career. More precise display names: MultiCreditContributor / ThreeCreditContributor.
- MultiGenreFilm, MultiAwardFilm and FrequentProductionCompany are not included as inferred classes: different genre/award/film IRIs alone do not establish inequality. COUNT DISTINCT can answer a database-style question, but cannot be presented as OWL DL entailment.

### Reference scope

The official 2016-10 reference and official extraction-framework development vocabulary (790 classes) were checked. Semantic alternatives reviewed include Actor, MovieDirector, ScreenWriter, Producer, Writer, ArtisticGenre, LiteraryGenre, MovieGenre; dbo:occupation ranges over PersonFunction, while dbo:role and artistFunction are strings and cannot replace the local credit-to-role entity link. dbo:year (gYear) is generic, whereas ex:releaseYear explicitly represents an integer earliest-release summary; it does not claim equivalence to dbo:year or a complete releaseDate. The archived reference hash is: a0ca30c8f25cf2d2957639dcad4fd1115f37a856d6d542fd50bba3bf9fa6bf9f. The current official runtime, starring and MovieGenre pages were cross-checked. Absence in this version is not proof that no equivalent vocabulary exists anywhere; local CREATE/EXTEND decisions are scoped to the checked DBpedia vocabulary and the stated meanings.

### Target size

The overview uses 14 main concepts: dbo:Film, Person, Actor, Company, Award, MovieGenre, Country, Language; ex:Contribution, ContributionRole, Filmmaker, ActionFilm, AwardWinningFilm and MultiCreditContributor. Supporting hierarchy, provenance and inferred subsets are listed separately. There are 10 domain inferred classes, including seven additional classes requested in section 13, plus four supporting credit subclasses and the reused Actor inference. This deliberately exceeds the approximate 5–8 final target to satisfy the stronger requirement of seven additional supported classes; no empty classes were added to reach a count.

No symmetric, transitive or inverse-functional flags are added. contributedTo is non-simple because it has a property chain; cardinality is placed on the simple hasContribution property, not contributedTo. Standard owl:sameAs and prov:wasDerivedFrom remain as identity/provenance predicates; they are not custom domain properties.

## 4. TABLE 3 — Data properties

rdfs:label is reused as an annotation property with language-tagged text; it is intentionally not declared owl:DatatypeProperty. There are 19 object + 5 datatype properties in the design, excluding built-in and metadata predicates.

Group A queries use asserted.ttl. Group B needs schema and hierarchy closure; group C uses inferred.ttl together with schema + asserted data. Query 27 uses the named graphs in before_after.trig. Entity-result queries restrict results to local resource IRIs and exclude sameAs aliases; the class-count table uses the same local identity scope. Query 8 returns a literal and query 12 returns class URIs, so they use the corresponding value/class scope.

## 8. TABLE 7 — Five strongest verified demos

| Question | Initial data | DBpedia reuse | Custom rule | Inferred result | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Who is an Actor? | Real source triples below | dbo:Film / Person / Actor / genre / award | starring range + hierarchy | 769 newly entailed local members | Reusable explicit semantics; before/after verified |
| Who is a Filmmaker? | Real source triples below | dbo:Film / Person / Actor / genre / award | (dbo:Person and (ex:hasContribution some ex:DirectingContribution or ex:hasContribution some ex:WritingContribution or ex:hasContribution some ex:ProducingContribution)) | 89 newly entailed local members | Reusable explicit semantics; before/after verified |
| Which films are ActionFilm? | Real source triples below | dbo:Film / Person / Actor / genre / award | (dbo:Film and dbo:genre some ex:ActionGenre) | 12 newly entailed local members | Reusable explicit semantics; before/after verified |
| Who has three provably distinct credits? | Real source triples below | dbo:Film / Person / Actor / genre / award | (dbo:Person and ex:hasContribution min 3 ex:Contribution) | 7 newly entailed local members | Reusable explicit semantics; before/after verified |
| Which action films received an award? | Real source triples below | dbo:Film / Person / Actor / genre / award | (ex:ActionFilm and ex:AwardWinningFilm) | 10 newly entailed local members | Reusable explicit semantics; before/after verified |

MultiGenreFilm was a preferred demo, but the real DL run inferred zero members. The fourth demo uses genuine min 3 reasoning instead. This meets the cardinality objective without inventing genre inequality.

## 9. Five complete Semantic Web demonstrations

### Who is an Actor?

QUESTION: Who is an Actor?

INITIAL TRIPLES:

res:person-Q1016897 http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type dbo:Person .
```

DBPEDIA VOCABULARY: dbo:Film, dbo:Person, dbo:Actor and the source-supported properties in Table 2.

ONTOLOGY RULE: dbo:starring rdfs:range dbo:Actor; Actor subclass Artist subclass Person subclass Agent.

REASONING: The source relation supplies existential witnesses. Supporting credit classes follow role hasValue restrictions. For min 3, the three role individuals are distinct by their controlled meanings; functional hasRole forces the corresponding credits to be distinct. HermiT classified the complete graph.

INFERRED KNOWLEDGE: `res:person-Q1016897 rdf:type dbo:Actor`. This type has zero direct assertions in the input graph.

SPARQL:

```sparql
PREFIX ex: <https://movie-lod-semantic-web.laminhtrung2001.chatgpt.site/ontology#>
PREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>
PREFIX res: <https://movie-lod-semantic-web.laminhtrung2001.chatgpt.site/resource/>

```

RESULT: 769 newly entailed local individuals; example Burr Steers (res:person-Q1016897).

WHY THIS DEMONSTRATES SEMANTIC WEB: The ontology makes the classification and shared vocabulary explicit and reusable across consumers. SQL joins, recursive queries and rule systems can reproduce many of these answers; the advantage is declared semantics, interoperable identifiers, open-world entailment and consistency checking, not an inability of databases to compute them.

ONTOLOGY RULE: (dbo:Person and (ex:hasContribution some ex:DirectingContribution or ex:hasContribution some ex:WritingContribution or ex:hasContribution some ex:ProducingContribution))

REASONING: The source relation supplies existential witnesses. Supporting credit classes follow role hasValue restrictions. For min 3, the three role individuals are distinct by their controlled meanings; functional hasRole forces the corresponding credits to be distinct. HermiT classified the complete graph.

## 10. Full definitions, source witnesses and OWL expressions

### ex:ActingContribution

REUSE/EXTEND rationale: Local credit record classified by a fixed role; DBpedia Actor describes a person, not this record.

CRAWLED SUPPORT: Credit claim corresponding to Actor

MANCHESTER: `(ex:Contribution and ex:hasRole value ex:ActorRole)`

OWL EXPRESSION: EquivalentClasses(ex:ActingContribution ObjectIntersectionOf(ex:Contribution ObjectHasValue(ex:hasRole ex:ActorRole)))

REAL INDIVIDUAL: Alien — actor — Sigourney Weaver (`res:contribution-Q103569-Q102124-actor`).

ASSERTED / INFERRED: No direct assertion of this type; HermiT entails membership. The role→credit→person classes need approximately 2–4 explanatory steps; OWL semantics is not procedural and does not prescribe evaluation order.

## 11. Cardinality and validation limitations

Exactly 1 constrains each Contribution endpoint and role. It does not validate completeness under the open-world assumption: an absent filler may exist without an explicit assertion. Structural checks must separately enforce that the exported record contains its three fields.

At least 2 / at least 3 are genuine HermiT results on hasContribution. Example: Christopher Nolan has distinct directing, writing and producing credit records; those records cannot collapse into one because hasRole is functional and DirectorRole, WriterRole and ProducerRole are distinct. No inequality is fabricated for people, genres, awards, companies or films.

The negative MultiGenreFilm test separately adds the requested min 2 genre definition and obtains zero DL members. A production class is excluded because the dataset cannot prove two genre fillers distinct. Future additions require source-supported inequality or a justified identity model; a blanket AllDifferent on Wikidata IDs is not justified by syntax.

## 12. Checklist and reproduction

- [x] Official DBpedia reference checked and hashed; reused term meanings, domain/range preserved.
- [x] No ex:Film, Person, Actor, Award, Genre, Language, Country, Company or Organisation clones.
- [x] Every extension maps to crawled claims or documented source-record metadata.
- [x] All demo individuals exist in the crawled dataset.
- [x] All retained defined classes have genuinely inferred members.
- [x] Equivalent classes, existential/value/cardinality restrictions and hierarchy present.
- [x] Inverse, subproperty and chain reasoning present; no gratuitous property characteristics.
- [x] Seven explanatory inference chains and 27 executed competency questions.
- [x] Five verified demo cases with no false claim that SQL cannot reproduce them.
- [x] Genuine min 2/min 3 DL results and explicit negative genre-cardinality test.
- [x] No MP4 videos included; removed at user request.
- [ ] Zero-result MultiGenreFilm / MultiAwardFilm / FrequentProductionCompany: require additional justified evidence before inclusion.
- [x] Archived official ontology, official development vocabulary and relevant live term meanings checked; equivalence decisions remain scoped to these references.

Run:

```sh
make build
make reason JAVA=/path/to/java
make validate
make test
```

Open ontology/Movie_Knowledge_Graph.owl directly in Protégé; it combines the schema and asserted facts without pre-asserting inferred classes. Start HermiT and inspect the example types; inferred.ttl is exported entailment evidence, not source assertions. before_after.trig supports query 27. Temporary RDF/XML reasoner inputs are removed after each run, preserving one authoritative full OWL export.

## Property-by-property semantic reuse audit

The comparison checks the relation meaning, argument direction, entity level, range and units; lexical resemblance alone is insufficient.

| Property | Decision | Semantic comparison |
|---|---|---|
| dbo:director | REUSE | Same relation/value semantics as the checked DBpedia property, with its original domain and range. Runtime is converted to the reference unit of seconds. |
| dbo:starring | REUSE | Same relation/value semantics as the checked DBpedia property, with its original domain and range. Runtime is converted to the reference unit of seconds. |
| dbo:writer | REUSE | Same relation/value semantics as the checked DBpedia property, with its original domain and range. Runtime is converted to the reference unit of seconds. |
| dbo:producer | REUSE | Same relation/value semantics as the checked DBpedia property, with its original domain and range. Runtime is converted to the reference unit of seconds. |
| dbo:productionCompany | REUSE | Same relation/value semantics as the checked DBpedia property, with its original domain and range. Runtime is converted to the reference unit of seconds. |
| dbo:award | REUSE | Same relation/value semantics as the checked DBpedia property, with its original domain and range. Runtime is converted to the reference unit of seconds. |
| dbo:genre | REUSE | Same relation/value semantics as the checked DBpedia property, with its original domain and range. Runtime is converted to the reference unit of seconds. |
| dbo:country | REUSE | Same relation/value semantics as the checked DBpedia property, with its original domain and range. Runtime is converted to the reference unit of seconds. |
| dbo:language | REUSE | Same relation/value semantics as the checked DBpedia property, with its original domain and range. Runtime is converted to the reference unit of seconds. |
| ex:hasContribution | CREATE | dbo:occupation links a PersonFunction, not a film-credit record. The local property refers to n-ary source credits. |
| ex:contributionBy | CREATE | dbo:director/writer/starring refer from Work/Film to people; this relation originates from a credit record, so they are not semantically interchangeable. |
| ex:contributionTo | CREATE | The domain is a credit association, not an Agent or Work. This is the film endpoint of the n-ary model. |
| ex:contributionOf | CREATE | Inverse of the film endpoint of the local n-ary association; not a Film-to-Person relation. |
| ex:hasRole | CREATE | dbo:role and dbo:artistFunction have string ranges; the controlled-role entity of a functional credit record has distinct object semantics. |
| ex:contributedTo | CREATE | Covers every collected credit role through a shared chain. director/starring/writer/producer are narrower and opposite-direction properties. |
| ex:directed | CREATE | Inverse of dbo:director; cannot reuse that forward predicate with its arguments reversed. It is also a subproperty of the broader local contributedTo. |
| ex:actedIn | CREATE | Inverse of dbo:starring; forward dbo:starring cannot denote the reversed relation. |
| ex:productionOf | CREATE | Inverse of dbo:productionCompany; preserving direction is necessary for semantic equivalence. |
| ex:sourceSnapshot | CREATE | More specific than prov:wasDerivedFrom: points to a locally saved response record with retrieval timestamp and content hash, not merely any source entity. |
| dbo:runtime | REUSE | Same relation/value semantics as the checked DBpedia property, with its original domain and range. Runtime is converted to the reference unit of seconds. |
| ex:releaseYear | CREATE | Derived earliest-release-year integer summary from P577. dbo:releaseDate requires a date; dbo:year is a generic gYear and does not express the earliest-release summary. No equivalence or invented full date is asserted. |
| ex:sourceUrl | CREATE | Literal lexical request endpoint stored in the snapshot manifest. DBpedia has no matching request-metadata datatype property in the checked vocabulary; prov:wasDerivedFrom is separately retained as an IRI relation. |
| ex:retrievedAt | CREATE | Retrieval instant of a local response snapshot, not a film releaseDate, generic date, or creation time of the original remote entity. |
| ex:sha256 | CREATE | SHA-256 checksum of the exact crawled response bytes, not a generic title, name, code or identifier of the represented film/person. |
